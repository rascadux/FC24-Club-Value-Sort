Script for FC24 game to sort the players of your club from highest to lowest price.

# Requirements
- Python 3
- Paletools
- Excel

## Important steps
1. To use the script you must first install paletools from [https://pale.tools/fifa/paletools.html](url).
2. Run it with the FC Companion webapp.
3. Go to Club Analyzer -> Export as CSV.
5. Run the correction.py script with ```python3 correction.py```.
6. Convert the resulting CSV to Excel, separating data by columns.
7. Run the python script with ```python3 script_values.py```.
8. Change the "your_file.xlsx" with the actual file name of the new Excel created.

## You will need to use PIP to install the following libraries:
- requests
- csv
- bs4
- openpyxl

## Players data ouput format:
- After running the script the user will have the data saved as CSV file, which must be converted to .xmls to sort by price.

## Why need the ```correction.py```
You need to convert the CSV with this script because Paletools downloads the CSV file not in utf8 format so characters like "Ã©" or similar will not be correct in the CSV file downloaded.
